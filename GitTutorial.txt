1. git init - to make a folder as repository

2. git status - to see the status of uncomitted and to be uploaded changes

3.git add 1.txt

--This needs to be added before commiting any file to repository
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

4. git commit -m "comment"

5. git log --> metadata about commit

to link to github repository(just 1 time activity)
git remote add origin https://github.com/nishantpandey107/GitLearning.git

to push commited changes to repository
git push -u origin master



now we will download the changes from hub to local
either by fetch followed by merge (if any conflict then)
git fetch origin master ------> only update the local staged repos, and not actual files
git merge origin/master -------> this will update the files

or by pull(just to get the latest code)
git pull origin master


to break the connection from local to server
git remote remove origin

connect the local to another repositories
git remote add origin https://github.com/nishantpandey107/GitLearning.git


to synch unrelated chnages
git pull origin master --allow -unrelated-histories
